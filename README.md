Salut!
------

Salutr is a straightforward, single click app that allows users to send
greetings to other users. It was built using Ruby on Rails, JQuery and
PostgreSQL, running on Pusher websockets.

It's very simple and light, allowing additional features (such as choosing
other words other than Salut to be sent) to be added in the future.

While it was mostly a study app, it was helpful in understanding how to build
an app using websockets. Its simplicity of a one-page site brought a few
insights in how to design routes and controllers for a single dashboard app.
